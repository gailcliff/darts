EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT
Dart doesn't have the primitive variable types that exist in some languages. Everything is an object and can be null, e.g, an int can be null (int?)
int foo = 8;
double bar = 3.142;

print(foo.isEven);
print(bar.round());


Type Inference
You donâ€™t even have to tell it the type of a variable, and Dart can still figure out what you mean.
var someNumber = 10;
someNumber = 15; // OK
someNumber = 3.14159; // No, no, no.
